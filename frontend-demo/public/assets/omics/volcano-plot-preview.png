# Volcano Plot Images

To complete the integration, please save your volcano plot images as:
- volcano-plot-preview.png (for the small preview in the panel)
- volcano-plot-full.png (for the full expanded view)

The images should show:
- Volcano Plot - OSD-467 (HLU vs Control, Cortical Bone)
- Top Differentially Expressed Genes
- Highlighted Gene Table with fold changes and p-values

Once you add these images, the Omics Lens will automatically display them for bone domain queries!
